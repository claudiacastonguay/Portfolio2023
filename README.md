# Portfolio2023
Portfolio with updated dependencies.


This Github repository for my portfolio does not show all of the development stages of coding it from scratch. The original repository I created for my portfolio was created in 2021 and had several outdated dependencies which caused it to fail to deploy.

In late 2023, I created this repository to update all of the dependencies and fix certain pages and components to get the site to properly deploy with no errors. Therefore, this repository does not show all of the steps I took to code this site from scratch.

If you would like to view the original Github repository created in 2021 that shows all of the development states taken to code the site from scratch, you can view it here: https://github.com/claudiacastonguay/Portfolio. 

Thanks!
